# ArtGAN/Improved ArtGAN

Updated on October 25, 2022 (Wikiart Artist download link is updated)

Updated on August 18, 2018 (Improved ArtGan models are included)

Released on May 20, 2018.

# Description

This is implementation of our TIP-19 work with titled [Improved ArtGAN for Conditional Synthesis of Natural Image and Artwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09533). The preliminary version of this work was presented earlier in ICIP-17 with titled [ArtGAN: Artwork Synthesis with Conditional Categorial GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03410). 

The details of the model settings and training scheme can be found at [this PDF](http://cs-chan.com/doc/ArtGAN_supp.pdf).

# Prerequisites
- Python 2.7
- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git)
- (Optional) [Nervana's Systems neon](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon.git)
- (Optional) [Nervana's Systems aeon](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/aeon.git)

\* Neon and aeon are required to load data. If other data loader is used, neon and aeon are not required. But, make sure that data format is 'NCHW'.
